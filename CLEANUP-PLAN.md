# Project Cleanup Plan - COMPLETED

### Documentation Consolidation

## Future Tasks

If additional cleanup is needed in the future:

- [ ] Consider removing this CLEANUP-PLAN.md file once no longer needed
- [ ] Regularly review and update the DEPLOYMENT.md file with any new deployment options or best practices
