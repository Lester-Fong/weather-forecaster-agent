# Apache-Based Deployment for Fly.io Web Interface

If you're encountering issues with the default Nginx-based deployment through Fly.io's web interface, this alternative Apache-based approach might help.

## Steps to Use the Apache Configuration

1. Before deploying via the Fly.io web interface, make these changes locally:

```bash
# Rename the Apache configuration to be the default Dockerfile
mv Dockerfile Dockerfile.nginx
mv Dockerfile.apache Dockerfile

# Use the Apache fly.toml configuration
mv fly.toml fly.nginx.toml
mv fly.apache.toml fly.toml

# Commit these changes
git add .
git commit -m "Switch to Apache-based configuration"
git push origin master
```

2. Follow the standard deployment process using the Fly.io web interface as outlined in the [Fly.io GitHub Deployment Guide](docs/fly-io-github-deployment.md)

## Why This Might Help

- The Apache-based configuration is simpler and more widely recognized
- Many deployment platforms have better built-in detection for Apache + Laravel combinations
- The Dockerfile has explicit labels identifying it as a Laravel application

## Switching Back

If you want to switch back to the Nginx configuration:

```bash
# Rename the configurations back
mv Dockerfile Dockerfile.apache
mv Dockerfile.nginx Dockerfile

# Use the Nginx fly.toml configuration
mv fly.toml fly.apache.toml
mv fly.nginx.toml fly.toml

# Commit these changes
git add .
git commit -m "Switch back to Nginx-based configuration"
git push origin master
```
